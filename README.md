### A Multimodal AI System for the BigQuery AI Hackathon

This repository contains the code and resources for "The Airbnb AI Consultant," a project designed to predict listing success and provide actionable, AI-generated advice for hosts.

## üöÄ Overview

Millions of Airbnb hosts rely on guesswork to create their listings. This project introduces a data-driven solution: a multimodal AI system that analyzes a listing's text, photos, and core data to provide a complete "AI Scorecard."

*   **Predictive Modeling:** A classification model predicts if a listing will achieve "Top Tier" status (4.9+ rating).
*   **Insight Generation:** The model reveals the "secret formula" by identifying the most important features for success.
*   **Generative AI:** Google's Gemini model synthesizes these insights into human-readable, expert-level advice.

## üåü Key Results & "Secret Formula"

Our analysis revealed that the most important features for a Top Tier listing are not simple numbers like price, but the **keywords in the description** and the **features in the photos**.
